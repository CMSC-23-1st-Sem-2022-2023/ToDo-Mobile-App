## Things you did in the code
Used the sample in the discussion as my base code then added the input fields for first name and last name and input validators.\
To implement input validators, I used a form and converted the textfields as textformfields.\


## Challenges faced
When it was just a text field, error text was not showing. Thus, I used a form and text form fields and just use the built in validate method.\
