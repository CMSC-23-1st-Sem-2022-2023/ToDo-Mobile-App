## Things you did in the code
To implement milestone 1, I used exercise 7 as my base code and just edited the signup page and the user model.\
I added input fields for birthday, location, bio, and initialize the arrray for friends, sentFriendRequest, and\
receivedFriendrequests. For milestone 2, I used my exercise 6 to implement the functions like accepting and\
declining a friend request, and deleting a friend. Moreover, I used exercise 2 as my base code to implement the\
profile page. I also added an app drawer to navigate to the different screens â€” Todos Page, Friends page, Profile,\
and Logout button. For milestone 3, I used the week 7 discussion code as my base code to implement to features\
like adding, deleting, and editing a todo. I just edited the base codes in a way that would satisfy or implement\
the said features in the specification.


## Challenges faced
At first, I used another stream to fetch data for users together with a todo stream. But when I'm going to the friensd page,\
it is just loading. It seem like my stream for user is encountering a problem or getting blocked, thus, I just used one\
stream for todo and just fetch all the users at the start of the app or when a user logged in.

## Test Cases
Happy paths: 
User tapped sign up button and was directed to sign up page\
![Signup](/images/SignupPage.png)
