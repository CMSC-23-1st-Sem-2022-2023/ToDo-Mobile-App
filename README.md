## Milestone 3


## Things you did in the code
To implement milestone 1, I used exercise 7 as my base code and just edited the signup page and the user model.\
I added input fields for birthday, location, bio, and initialize the arrray for friends, sentFriendRequest, and\
receivedFriendrequests. For milestone 2, I used my exercise 6 to implement the functions like accepting and\
declining a friend request, and deleting a friend. Moreover, I used exercise 2 as my base code to implement the\
profile page. I also added an app drawer to navigate to the different screens â€” Todos Page, Friends page, Profile,\
and Logout button. For milestone 3, I used the week 7 discussion code as my base code to implement to features\
like adding, deleting, and editing a todo.



## Challenges faced
The data from firebase is sometimes late to fetch, thus the user I used in profile screen is somketimes null

## Test Cases
Happy paths: 
User tapped sign up button and was directed to sign up page\
![Signup](/images/SignupPage.png)

User inputted valid email and password in login page and was logged in.\
![Login](/images/LoginSuccess.png)
